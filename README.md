# monorepo-workshop

## 0 - Setup a monorepo with mixed projects

## 1 - Sharing some common logic

Let's create a util-package that will be accessible within the respective projects
(Caveat: different imports could mess with resolution - let's see how to fix that)

## 2 - Sharing some platform specific logic

Let's see how shared code behave when there are platform specificities

## 3 - Assembling those bricks to create a design system

Let's see how to define primitives components that can be shared between web & native

## 4 - React Strict Dom ? React Native web ?

How what we build works with the past and future of web sharing technologies
